CMake is needed to install this software.  The command to build and install is
very simple, with one complication: out-of-source builds are required.  That
simply means that you can't build the software at the top of the source tree.
Instead, create a build directory and build from there.  For example, the build
directory could be a subfolder in the source tree:

$> cd /path/to/xcdf/src
$> mkdir build
$> cd build

Then run CMake and compile the software

$> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /path/to/xcdf/src
$> make
$> make install

Note that if /path/to/install is a relative path CMake will expand it properly.
